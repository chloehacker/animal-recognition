# Public Transportation as a Proxy for Public Perception of Climate Change: An analysis through Python

This series of annotated notebooks will take you through the steps of importing a city's public transportation ridership data, presenting the data through a number of maps and analyzing the data after certain events that relate to climate issues and seeing if they differ from the average ridership.

The goal of this project is to lead anyone who is interested through a diverse and in depth analysis of ridership data in conjunction with momentous events that have occured in the recent past regarding climate change issues. There are also analyses that relate to ridership and climate.
