In reviewing your peer's projects did you find that their README files made it clear what their project is, 
how to install it, and how to use it? Do you think that your README file does a good job at this?

apf2139:There are not instructions as of yet. I think my readme does a good job so far, and I'm updating as I continue to work on my project.

Wenyi909:

Did your peer have Python scripts in a directory named project, and were you able to understand the structure 
of the python scripts?

Wenyi909:

Did your peer provide example notebooks in the notebooks directory? Does the README file link to, or tell you 
about the example notebooks? Were you able to understand from the example notebooks how to use the code, or 
what your peer is trying to solve in the notebook?
apf2139: Yes, there are example notebooks. No links in the readme yet. The notebook was well written and explained so I was able to follow along with the notebook.

Wenyi909:

Did you come up with any ideas for improving your own project by reviewing your peer's project directories?
apf2139: Imrovements that were inspired by this notebook were to make sure that my readme is very clear and directs the reader to where I want them to go to go through and use my notebooks.
