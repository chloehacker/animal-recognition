**In reviewing your peer's projects did you find that their README files made it clear what their project is, 
how to install it, and how to use it? Do you think that your README file does a good job at this?

apf2139: There are not instructions as of yet.

anikap22:The instructions are in the work, incomplete but there.

Wenyi909: No instructions yet.

I think my readme does a good job so far, and I'm updating as I continue to work on my project.

**Did your peer have Python scripts in a directory named project, and were you able to understand the structure 
of the python scripts?

apf2139: There is no projects directory yet.

anikap22: Yes there is and I am able to understand the structure of the python scripts. Well documented and explained throughout. 

Wenyi909: Project directory exists, but no scripts in it.

**Did your peer provide example notebooks in the notebooks directory? Does the README file link to, or tell you 
about the example notebooks? Were you able to understand from the example notebooks how to use the code, or 
what your peer is trying to solve in the notebook?

apf2139: Yes, there are example notebooks. No links in the readme yet. The notebook was well written and explained so I was able to follow along with the notebook.

anikap22: Yes there are. The readme tells you where to go to find example notebooks. I undersood the goals of the notebook and the corresponding code for the notebooks.

Wenyi909: Notebooks are not linked but they exist and the code is well written and can be followed along by the user. More markdown throughout could make it easier to follow along with.

**Did you come up with any ideas for improving your own project by reviewing your peer's project directories?

apf2139: Imrovements that were inspired by this notebook were to make sure that my readme is very clear and directs the reader to where I want them to go to go through and use my notebooks.

anikap22: Improve markdown documentation throughout the notebooks to make them clearer. 

Wenyi909: Like from the other notebooks, enhance markdown documentation through the notebook and make sure my readme is detailed for the user.
