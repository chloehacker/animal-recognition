**Now that you have seen many full research projects saved online as GitHub repositories do you plan to use GitHub 
for your future projects as a way to store code and data in the cloud and to share your progress with others?**

Yes, I would. It makes things much more productive to be able to track the changes that are being made, and see propsed changes from other people. And like most things you do, it is better to have multiple opinions and inputs to achieve the best result. This method of effortless collaboration is very useful and intuitive for users.

**Did you project accomplish the goals that you set out for yourself in your proposal? If not, why? What was the 
hardest problem in your project that were able to overcome? What, if any, was a problem that you were unable to 
overcome in your project within the given time?**

My project accomplished some of the goals that I set out for myself. I think I had the hardest time not being able to directly work with anyone, I feel like if this were a partner project it would've been a lot easier to troubleshoot issues. Google is really helpful for finding some solutions but also it is not the most helpful when you have a specific issue that relates directly to your specific project. The hardest problem that I was able to overcome was figuring out interactive mapping with plotly. There are a lot of lines of code you need for it, and it took me some time to decipher it all and then apply it to my specific data set. A problem I was not able to overcome was combining datasets to be able to visualize them together and to be able to run some type of ANOVA or statistical analysis to see what data was "normal" or not. This is definitely something I hope to accomplish with more time working on this project. 

**Do you feel that you've learned the skills necessary perform data analysis in Python, and to write your own
program or pipeline for data analysis? What skills do you think you need to work on further, and where would 
you look to find more information about learning these skills?**

I feel like I have a pretty solid baseline knowledge that is needed to perform data analysis in Python/to wrtie me own program but I think I am lacking in experience. And lacking in experience troubleshooting problems that arise. I need to work on writing my own class objects to perform a function. I know this is something we did a lot in class but I think because the data we were writing it for was unfamiliar to me it made it difficult to process and understand it completely. Using a more relatable data set I think would set me up for a better understanding of all the moving parts to defining a class object. I feel like I could look to github or any of the stackoverflow pages to get help with Python.
